#### [allocator.requirements]
MC: Proposed change is to strike the word valid [from "...when `a` and `(a + n)` are
valid dereferenceable pointer values..."]. [struck]

#### [concept.swappable]
STL: Does the self-swap case [in p1] deserve a note? [noted]

STL: What if someone expects to find enum through ADL? [added "or enumeration"]
