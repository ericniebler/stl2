* STL "dereferenceable" meaning valid expression is weird, we use that term to describe the runtime property. 

* "E1 and E2 both satisfy Readable" is bad.

238

* decaying the argument to IndirectCallable but not to result_of is testing the result type of different cv-qualified function object types. Open a separate issue for this after applying 238.

189

* Need to && the types before passing to result_of. (May occur elsewhere in the TS as well.)

General:
* Start a list of integration concerns.

* Ensure we have an issue to sweep the concept definitions to guard against parameter decay.

* Need some way to dump the issues into the document history.
