The design of this specification is based, in part, on a concept
specification of the algorithms part of the \Cpp standard library, known
as the ``Palo Alto report''~(\cite{palo-alto}), which was developed by a large
group of experts as a test of the expressive power of the idea of
concepts.

The authors would like to thank Andrew Sutton for his work on the Concepts TS~(\ref{intro.refs}),
for his help formalizing the ideas of the range-v3 library~\cite{range-v3} on which this
work is based, and for his review of this document.

Sean Parent has made major contributions to both the foundations and the wording of this
document.

Stephan T. Lavavej offered a careful review of much of this document, a non-trivial undertaking.

We would also like to thank the members of the Ranges SG who offered feedback on early drafts,
especially Tony Van Eerd and Walter Brown.

Christopher Di Bella has contributed many editorial fixes.

This work was made possible by a generous grant from the Standard \Cpp Foundation.
