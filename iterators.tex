\pnum
\indextext{requirements!iterator}%
Iterators are a generalization of pointers that allow a \Cpp program to work with different data structures
(\added{for example, }containers\added{ and ranges}) in a uniform manner.
To be able to construct template algorithms that work correctly and
efficiently on different types of data structures, the library formalizes not just the interfaces but also the
semantics and complexity assumptions of iterators.
All input iterators
\tcode{i}
support the expression
\tcode{*i},
resulting in a value of some object type
\tcode{T},
called the
\term{value type}
of the iterator.
All output iterators support the expression
\tcode{*i = o}
where
\tcode{o}
is a value of some type that is in the set of types that are
\term{writable}
to the particular iterator type of
\tcode{i}.
\removed{All iterators
\tcode{i}
for which the expression
\tcode{(*i).m}
is well-defined, support the expression
\tcode{i->m}
with the same semantics as
\tcode{(*i).m}.}
For every iterator type
\tcode{X}
for which
equality is defined, there is a corresponding signed integer type called the
\term{difference type}
of the iterator.

\pnum
Since iterators are an abstraction of pointers, their semantics is
a generalization of most of the semantics of pointers in \Cpp.
This ensures that every
function template
that takes iterators
works as well with regular pointers.
This International Standard defines
\changed{five}{seven} categories of iterators, according to the operations
defined on them:
\added{\techterm{weak input iterators}, }
\techterm{input iterators},
\added{\techterm{weak output iterators}, }
\techterm{output iterators},
\techterm{forward iterators},
\techterm{bidirectional iterators}
and
\techterm{random access iterators},
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:iterators.relations}.

\begin{floattable}{Relations among iterator categories}{tab:iterators.relations}
{lllll}
\topline
\textbf{Random Access}          &   $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Bidirectional}    &
$\rightarrow$ \textbf{Forward}  &   $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Input}            & \added{   $\rightarrow$ \textbf{WeakInput}}           \\
                        &   &   &   $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Output}           & \added{   $\rightarrow$ \textbf{WeakOutput}}          \\
\end{floattable}

\begin{addedblock}
\pnum
The seven categories of iterators correspond to the iterator concepts
\tcode{WeakInputIterator},
\tcode{InputIterator},
\tcode{WeakOutputIterator},
\tcode{OutputIterator},
\tcode{ForwardIterator},
\tcode{BidirectionalIterator}, and
\tcode{RandomAccess\-Iterator}, respectively. The generic term \techterm{iterator} refers to
any type that models \tcode{WeakIterator}.
\end{addedblock}

\pnum
\changed{Forward}{Input} iterators satisfy all the requirements of \added{weak }input
iterators and can be used whenever \changed{an}{a weak} input iterator is specified;
\added{Forward iterators also satisfy all the requirements of
input iterators and can be used whenever an input iterator is specified;}
Bidirectional iterators also satisfy all the requirements of
forward iterators and can be used whenever a forward iterator is specified;
Random access iterators also satisfy all the requirements of bidirectional
iterators and can be used whenever a bidirectional iterator is specified.

\pnum
Iterators that further satisfy the requirements of \added{weak }output iterators are
called \defn{mutable iterator}{s}. Nonmutable iterators are referred to
as \defn{constant iterator}{s}.

\pnum
Just as a regular pointer to an array guarantees that there is a pointer value pointing past the last element
of the array, so for any iterator type there is an iterator value that points past the last element of a
corresponding sequence.
These values are called
\term{past-the-end}
values.
Values of an iterator
\tcode{i}
for which the expression
\tcode{*i}
is defined are called
\term{dereferenceable}.
The library never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable.
Iterators can also have singular values that are not associated with any
sequence.
\enterexample
After the declaration of an uninitialized pointer
\tcode{x}
(as with
\tcode{int* x;}),
\tcode{x}
must always be assumed to have a singular value of a pointer.
\exitexample
Results of most expressions are undefined for singular values;
the only exceptions are destroying an iterator that holds a singular value,
the assignment of a non-singular value to
an iterator that holds a singular value, and\removed{, for iterators that satisfy the
\tcode{DefaultConstructible} requirements,} using a value-initialized iterator
as the source of a copy or move operation. \enternote This guarantee is not
offered for default initialization, although the distinction only matters for types
with trivial default constructors such as pointers or aggregates holding pointers.
\exitnote
In these cases the singular
value is overwritten the same way as any other value.
Dereferenceable
values are always non-singular.

\added{
\pnum
A
\term{sentinel}
is an abstraction of a past-the-end iterator. Sentinels are \tcode{Regular} types that can be used to denote
the end of a range. A sentinel and an iterator denoting a range shall be \tcode{EqualityComparable}. A
sentinel denotes an element when an iterator
\tcode{i}
compares equal to the sentinel, and
\tcode{i}
points to that element.}

\pnum
An iterator\added{ or sentinel}
\tcode{j}
is called
\term{reachable}
from an iterator
\tcode{i}
if and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of
the expression
\tcode{++i}
that makes
\tcode{i == j}.
If
\tcode{j}
is reachable from
\tcode{i},
they refer to elements of the same sequence.

\pnum
Most of the library's algorithmic templates that operate on data structures have interfaces that use ranges.
A
\term{range}
is a pair of iterators\added{ or an iterator and a sentinel} that designate the beginning and end of the computation.
A range \range{i}{i}
is an empty range;
in general, a range \range{i}{j}
refers to the elements in the data structure starting with the element
pointed to by
\tcode{i}
and up to but not including the element \changed{pointed to}{denoted} by
\tcode{j}.
Range \range{i}{j}
is valid if and only if
\tcode{j}
is reachable from
\tcode{i}.
The result of the application of functions in the library to invalid ranges is
undefined.

\pnum
All the categories of iterators require only those functions that are realizable for a given category in
constant time (amortized).
\removed{Therefore, requirement tables for the iterators do not have a complexity column.}

\pnum
Destruction of an iterator may invalidate pointers and references
previously obtained from that iterator.

\pnum
An
\techterm{invalid}
iterator is an iterator that may be singular.\footnote{This definition applies to pointers, since pointers are iterators.
The effect of dereferencing an iterator that has been invalidated
is undefined.
}

\pnum
In the following sections,
\tcode{a}
and
\tcode{b}
denote values of type
\tcode{X} or \tcode{const X},
\tcode{difference_type} and \tcode{reference} refer to the
types \tcode{\removed{iterator_traits<X>::difference_type}}\tcode{\added{DifferenceType<X>}} and
\tcode{\removed{iterator_traits<X>::ref\-erence}}~\tcode{\added{ReferenceType<X>}}, respectively,
\tcode{n}
denotes a value of
\tcode{difference_type},
\tcode{u},
\tcode{tmp},
and
\tcode{m}
denote identifiers,
\tcode{r}
denotes a value of
\tcode{X\&},
\tcode{t}
denotes a value of value type
\tcode{T},
\tcode{o}
denotes a value of some type that is writable to the \added{weak }output iterator.
\enternote For an iterator type \tcode{X} \changed{there must be an instantiation
of \tcode{iterator_traits<X>}~(\cxxref{iterator.traits})}{the type aliases
\tcode{DifferenceType<X>} and \tcode{ReferenceType<X>} must be well-formed}. \exitnote

If a type \tcode{I} has an associated value type, then \tcode{value_type<I>::type} shall name the

The \tcode{value_type} class template may be specialized on user-defined types.

\pnum
When instantiated with a type \tcode{I} that has a nested type \tcode{value_type},

\tcode{value_type<I>} shall have no nested type \tcode{type}. \enternote Some legacy output
iterators define a nested type named \tcode{value_type} that is an alias for \tcode{void}. These
types are not \tcode{Readable} and have no associated value types.\exitnote

\pnum
When instantiated with a type \tcode{I} that has a nested type \tcode{element_type},
\tcode{value_type<I>::type} names that type, unless it is not an object type~(\cxxref{basic.types}) in which case
\tcode{value_type<I>} shall have no nested type \tcode{type}. \enternote Smart pointers like
\tcode{shared_ptr<int>} are \tcode{Readable} and have an associated value type. But a smart pointer
like \tcode{shared_ptr<void>} is not \tcode{Readable} and has no associated value type.\exitnote

\rSec2[movewritable.iterators]{Concept MoveWritable}

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{Out} is \tcode{Readable},
then after the assignment \tcode{*o = move(v)}, \tcode{*o} is equal
to the value of \tcode{v} before the assignment.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
After the expression \tcode{*o = move(v)}, object \tcode{o} is not required to be dereferenceable.

\pnum
\tcode{v}'s state is unspecified. \enternote \tcode{v} must still meet the
requirements of the library component that is using it. The operations listed
in those requirements must work as specified whether \tcode{v} has been moved
from or not.\exitnote

\enternote
The only valid use of an \tcode{operator*} is on the left side of the assignment statement.
\textit{Assignment through the same value of the writable type happens only once.}

\rSec2[weaklyincrementable.iterators]{Concept WeaklyIncrementable}

The \tcode{WeaklyIncrementable} concept describes types that can be incremented with the pre-

\pnum
Not all arguments will be incrementable for a given type. For example $NaN$ is not a well-formed
floating point value and hence is not incrementable. Likewise, past-the-end iterators are also not
incrementable. This does not mean that the type does not model \tcode{WeaklyIncrementable}.

\item If \tcode{i} is incrementable, then \tcode{i++} moves \tcode{i} to the next element.
\item \tcode{++i} is valid if and only if \tcode{i++} is valid.

\ednote{Copied almost verbatim from the \tcode{InputIterator} description. This wording is removed
there.}

\pnum
\enternote For \tcode{WeaklyIncrementable} types, \tcode{a} equals \tcode{b} does not imply that \tcode{++a}
equals \tcode{++b}. (Equality does not guarantee the substitution property or referential
transparency.) Algorithms on weakly incrementable types should never attempt to pass
through the same incrementable value twice. They should be single pass algorithms. These algorithms
can be used with istreams as the source of the input data through the \tcode{istream_iterator} class
template.\exitnote

\rSec2[incrementable.iterators]{Concept Incrementable}

\enternote The requirement that \tcode{a} equals \tcode{b} implies \tcode{++a} equals \tcode{++b}

\pnum
The \tcode{Iterator} concept refines \tcode{WeakIterator}~(\ref{weakiterator.iterators}) and adds
the requirement that the iterator is equality comparable.

\pnum
In the \tcode{Iterator} concept, the set of values over which
\tcode{==} is (required to be) defined can change over time.
Each algorithm places additional requirements on the domain of
\tcode{==} for the iterator values it uses.
These requirements can be inferred from the uses that algorithm
makes of \tcode{==} and \tcode{!=}.

\rSec2[insert.iterators]{Insert iterators}

\pnum
To make it possible to deal with insertion in the same way as writing into an array, a special kind of iterator
adaptors, called
\techterm{insert iterators},
are provided in the library.
With regular iterator classes,

\begin{codeblock}
while (first != last) *result++ = *first++;
\end{codeblock}

causes a range \range{first}{last}
to be copied into a range starting with result.
The same code with
\tcode{result}
being an insert iterator will insert corresponding elements into the container.
This device allows all of the
copying algorithms in the library to work in the
\techterm{insert mode}
instead of the \techterm{regular overwrite} mode.

\pnum
An insert iterator is constructed from a container and possibly one of its iterators pointing to where
insertion takes place if it is neither at the beginning nor at the end of the container.
Insert iterators satisfy the requirements of output iterators.
\tcode{operator*}
returns the insert iterator itself.
The assignment
\tcode{operator=(const T\& x)}
is defined on insert iterators to allow writing into them, it inserts
\tcode{x}
right before where the insert iterator is pointing.
In other words, an insert iterator is like a cursor pointing into the
container where the insertion takes place.
\tcode{back_insert_iterator}
inserts elements at the end of a container,
\tcode{front_insert_iterator}
inserts elements at the beginning of a container, and
\tcode{insert_iterator}
inserts elements where the iterator points to in a container.
\tcode{back_inserter},
\tcode{front_inserter},
and
\tcode{inserter}
are three
functions making the insert iterators out of a container.

\pnum
Class template \tcode{common_iterator} is an iterator/sentinel adaptor that is
capable of representing a non-bounded range of elements (where the types of the
iterator and sentinel differ) as a bounded range (where they are the same). It
does this by holding either an iterator or a sentinel, and implementing the
equality comparison operators appropriately.

\pnum
\enternote The \tcode{common_iterator} type is useful for interfacing with legacy
code that expects the begin and end of a range to have the same type, and for
use in \tcode{common_type} specializations that are required to make
iterator/sentinel pairs model the \tcode{EqualityComparable} concept.\exitnote

Class \tcode{unreachable} is a sentinel type that can be used with any

The class template
\tcode{istream_iterator}
is an input iterator~(\ref{input.iterators}) that
reads (using
\tcode{operator\shr})
successive elements from the input stream for which it was constructed.
After it is constructed, and every time
\tcode{++}
is used, the iterator reads and stores a value of
\tcode{T}.
If the iterator fails to read and store a value of \tcode{T}
(\tcode{fail()}
on the stream returns
\tcode{true}),
the iterator becomes equal to the
\term{end-of-stream}
iterator value.
The constructor with no arguments
\tcode{istream_iterator()}
always constructs
an end-of-stream input iterator object, which is the only legitimate iterator to be used
for the end condition.
The result of
\tcode{operator*}
on an end-of-stream iterator is not defined.
For any other iterator value a
\tcode{const T\&}

The result of

For any other iterator value a

The behavior of a program that applies \tcode{operator++()} to an end-of-stream

It is impossible to store things into istream iterators.

Two non-end-of-stream iterators are equal when they are constructed from the same stream.

\rSec2[istreambuf.iterator]{Class template \tcode{istreambuf_iterator}}

\pnum
The
class template
\tcode{istreambuf_iterator}
defines an input iterator~(\ref{input.iterators}) that
reads successive
\textit{characters}
from the streambuf for which it was constructed.
\tcode{operator*}
provides access to the current input character, if any.
\enternote \tcode{operator->} may return a proxy. \exitnote
Each time
\tcode{operator++}
is evaluated, the iterator advances to the next input character.
If the end of stream is reached (\tcode{streambuf_type::sgetc()} returns
\tcode{traits::eof()}),
the iterator becomes equal to the
\term{end-of-stream}
iterator value.
The default constructor
\tcode{istreambuf_iterator()}
and the constructor
\tcode{istreambuf_iterator(0)}
both construct an end-of-stream iterator object suitable for use
as an end-of-range.
All specializations of \tcode{istreambuf_iterator} shall have a trivial copy
constructor, a \tcode{constexpr} default constructor, and a trivial destructor.

\pnum
The result of
\tcode{operator*()}
on an end-of-stream iterator is undefined.
\indextext{undefined behavior}%
For any other iterator value a
\tcode{char_type}
value is returned.
It is impossible to assign a character via an input iterator.

\rSec2[iterables.requirements]{Range requirements}

\rSec3[iterables.requirements.general]{In general}

\pnum
Ranges are an abstraction of containers that allow a C++ program to
operate on elements of data structures uniformly. It their simplest form, a
range object is one on which one can call \tcode{begin} and
\tcode{end} to get an iterator~(\ref{iterator.iterators}) and a
sentinel~(\ref{sentinel.iterators}) or an iterator. To be able to construct
template algorithms and range adaptors that work correctly and efficiently on
different types of sequences, the library formalizes not just the interfaces but
also the semantics and complexity assumptions of ranges.

\pnum
This International Standard defines three fundamental categories of ranges
based on the syntax and semantics supported by each: \techterm{range},
\techterm{sized range} and \techterm{view}, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:iterables.relations}.

\begin{floattable}{Relations among range categories}{tab:iterables.relations}
  {lll}
  \topline
  \textbf{Sized Range}  &               &                   \\
                        & $\searrow$    &                   \\
                        &               &  \textbf{Range}   \\
                        & $\nearrow$    &                   \\
  \textbf{View}         &               &                   \\
\end{floattable}

\pnum
The \tcode{Range} concept requires only that \tcode{begin} and \tcode{end}
return an iterator and a sentinel. \enternote An iterator is a valid sentinel.
\exitnote The \tcode{SizedRange} concept refines \tcode{Range} but adds
the requirement that the number of elements in the range can be determined
in constant time with the \tcode{size} function. The \tcode{View} concept describes
requirements on an \tcode{Range} type with constant-time copy and assign
operations.

\pnum
In addition to the three fundamental range categories, this standard defines
a number of convenience refinements of \tcode{Range} that group together requirements
that appear often in the concepts, algorithms, and range adaptors.
\techterm{Bounded ranges} are ranges for which \tcode{begin} and \tcode{end} return objects of the
same type. \techterm{Random access ranges} are ranges for which
\tcode{begin} returns a model of
\tcode{RandomAccessIterator}~(\ref{random.access.iterators}). The range
categories \techterm{bidirectional ranges},
\techterm{forward ranges},
\techterm{input ranges} and
\techterm{output ranges} are defined similarly.
\enternote There is no \techterm{weak input ranges} or
\techterm{weak output ranges} because of the \tcode{EqualityComparable}
requirement on iterators and sentinels. \exitnote \ednote{TODO: Rethink that because
a weak input range would not require (strongly) incrementable iterators.}

\rSec3[iterable.iterables]{Ranges}

\pnum
The \tcode{Range} concept defines the requirements of a type that allows
iteration over its elements by providing a \tcode{begin} iterator and an
\tcode{end} iterator or sentinel.

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T>
using IteratorType = decltype(begin(declval<T>()));

template <class T>
using SentinelType = decltype(end(declval<T>()));

template <class T>
concept bool Range@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@
  @\newtxt{return}@ requires(T t) {
    typename IteratorType<T>;
    typename SentinelType<T>;
    { begin(t) } -> IteratorType<T>;
    { end(t) } -> SentinelType<T>;
    requires Sentinel<SentinelType<T>, IteratorType<T>>@\newtxt{()}@;
  };
@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\tcode{begin} and \tcode{end} are required to be amortized constant time.
\enternote Most algorithms requiring this concept simply forward to an
\tcode{Iterator}-based algorithm by calling \tcode{begin} and \tcode{end}. \exitnote

\rSec3[sized.iterables]{Sized ranges}

\pnum
The \tcode{SizedRange} concept describes the requirements
of a \tcode{Range} type that knows its size in constant time with the
\tcode{size} function.

\begin{codeblock}
// \expos
template <class T>
concept bool @\xname{SizedRangeLike}@ =
  Range<T>@\newtxt{()}@ &&
  requires(T t) {
    { size(t) } -> Integral;
    requires Convertible<decltype(size(t)),
                         DifferenceType<IteratorType<T>>>@\newtxt{()}@;
  };

template <class T>
concept bool SizedRange@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@
  @\newtxt{return}@ @\xname{SizedRangeLike}@<T> && is_sized_range<T>::value;
@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
For any type \tcode{T}, \tcode{is_sized_range<T>} derives from
\tcode{true_type} if \tcode{T} models \tcode{\xname{SizedRangeLike}},
and \tcode{false_type} otherwise.

\pnum
Users are free to specialize \tcode{is_sized_range}. \enternote Users
may want to specialize \tcode{is_sized_range} to override the default in the
case of accidental conformance.\exitnote

\pnum
\enternote A possible implementation for \tcode{is_sized_range} is given below:

\begin{codeblock}
template <class R>
struct is_sized_range : false_type { };

template <@\xname{SizedRangeLike}@ R>
struct is_sized_range<R> : true_type { };
\end{codeblock}
\exitnote

\rSec3[range.iterables]{Views}

\pnum
The \tcode{View} concept describes the requirements of a \tcode{Range} type that
has constant time copy, move and assignment operators; that is, the cost of
these operations is not proportional to the number of elements in the \tcode{View}.

\pnum
\enterexample
Examples of \tcode{View}s are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \tcode{Range} type that wraps a pair of iterators.

\item A \tcode{Range} type that hold its elements by \tcode{shared_ptr}
and shares ownership with all its copies.

\item A \tcode{Range} type that generates its elements on demand.
\end{itemize}

A container~(\cxxref{containers}) is not a \tcode{View} since copying the
container copies the elements, which cannot be done in constant time.
\exitexample

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T>
concept bool View@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@
  @\newtxt{return}@ Range<T>@\newtxt{()}@ && Semiregular<T>@\newtxt{()}@ && is_view<T>::value;
@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
Since the difference between \tcode{Range} and
\tcode{View} is largely semantic, the
two are differentiated with the help of the \tcode{is_view} trait. Users may
specialize the \tcode{is_view} trait. By default,
\tcode{is_view} uses the following heuristics to determine whether an
\tcode{Range} type \tcode{T} is a \tcode{View}:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{T} derives from \tcode{view_base}, \tcode{is_view<T>::value}
is true.
\item If a top-level \tcode{const} changes \tcode{T}'s \tcode{IteratorType}'s
\tcode{ReferenceType} type, \tcode{is_view<T>::value}
is false. \enternote Deep \tcode{const}-ness implies element ownership, whereas shallow
\tcode{const}-ness implies reference semantics. \exitnote
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\enternote
Below is a possible implementation of the \tcode{is_view} trait.

\begin{codeblock}
struct view_base { };

// \expos
template <class T>
concept bool @\xname{ContainerLike}@ =
  Range<T>@\newtxt{()}@ &&
  !Same<ReferenceType<IteratorType<@\newtxt{remove_const_t<}@T@\newtxt{>}@ &>>,
        ReferenceType<IteratorType<const T &>>>@\newtxt{()}@;

template <class T>
struct is_view : false_type { };

template <Range T>
  requires Derived<remove_reference_t<T>, view_base>@\newtxt{()}@ ||
    !@\xname{ContainerLike}@<remove_reference_t<T>>
struct is_view<T> : true_type { };
\end{codeblock}
\exitnote

\rSec3[bounded.iterables]{Bounded ranges}

\pnum
The \tcode{BoundedRange} concept describes requirements of an \tcode{Range} type
for which \tcode{begin} and \tcode{end} return objects of the same type.
\enternote The standard containers~(\cxxref{containers}) are models of
\tcode{BoundedRange}. \exitnote

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T>
concept bool BoundedRange@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@

@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\rSec3[input.iterables]{Input ranges}

\pnum
The \tcode{InputRange} concept describes requirements of an \tcode{Range} type
for which \tcode{begin} returns a model of
\tcode{InputIterator}~(\ref{input.iterators}).

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T>
concept bool InputRange@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@

@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\rSec3[forward.iterables]{Forward ranges}

\pnum
The \tcode{ForwardRange} concept describes requirements of an
\tcode{InputRange} type for which \tcode{begin} returns a model of
\tcode{ForwardIterator}~(\ref{forward.iterators}).

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T>
concept bool ForwardRange@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@
  @\newtxt{return}@ InputRange<T>@\newtxt{()}@ && ForwardIterator<IteratorType<T>>@\newtxt{()}@;
@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\rSec3[bidirectional.iterables]{Bidirectional ranges}

\pnum
The \tcode{BidirectionalRange} concept describes requirements of a
\tcode{ForwardRange} type for which \tcode{begin} returns a model of
\tcode{BidirectionalIterator}~(\ref{bidirectional.iterators}).

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T>
concept bool BidirectionalRange@\newtxt{() \{}\oldtxt{ =}@
  @\newtxt{return}@ ForwardRange<T>@\newtxt{()}@ && BidirectionalIterator<IteratorType<T>>@\newtxt{()}@;
@\newtxt{\}}@
\end{codeblock}

\rSec3[random.access.iterables]{Random access ranges}

\pnum
