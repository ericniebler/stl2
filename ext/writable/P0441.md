# Introduction

This paper presents a design change to [N4560, the working paper for the Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Ranges (the "Ranges TS")][1][@n4560]. This work has already been speculatively integrated - along with the proposals in [P0370 "Ranges TS Design Updates Omnibus"][10][@p0370] - with the text of the working paper. The resulting document is [P0459 "C++ Extensions for Ranges: Speculative Combined Proposals"][9][@p0459]. We briefly discuss how the design of the `Writable` and `MoveWritable` concepts impacts the specification of algorithms, and propose to correct the problem by merging the two into a single concept.

<!--
## Revision history
### R0 -> R1
* Remove the section proposing relaxed semantics for the comparison function objects. Further reflection on this change during the meeting, and discussions of [P0307:	Making Optional Greater Equal Again](http://wg21.link/P0307) and [P0181: Ordered By Default](http://wg21.link/P0181), make it clear that this is the wrong approach.

* Remove the `move_sentinel` section that discussed adapting an iterator/sentinel pair into a "move" range. LEWG felt there was not sufficient motivation to address this problem at this time.

* Remove the empty section "Merge `Writable` and `MoveWritable`."
-->

## Motivation
The current Ranges TS Working Paper (N4560) includes two concepts used to describe relationships between a readable and a writable iterator, `MoveWritable` and `Writable`:

```c++
template <class Out, class T>
concept bool MoveWritable() {
  return Semiregular<Out>() &&
    requires(Out o, T t) {
      *o = std::move(t);
    }
}

template <class Out, class T>
concept bool Writable() {
  return MoveWritable<Out, T>() &&
    requires(Out o, const T t) {
      *o = t;
    }
}
```

with similar semantics for the assignment expressions, except that `t` is left unchanged by the assignment in `Writable` whereas `MoveWritable` leaves `t` in a valid but unspecified state. These concepts describe how an algorithm transfers values into its outputs. We could implement, e.g., `fill_n` as:

```c++
template <class T, WeaklyIncrementable Out>
  requires Writable<Out, T>()
void fill_n(Out out, difference_type_t<Out> n, const T& value) {
  for (; n > 0; --n, ++out) {
    *out = value;
  }
}
```

and know that the expression `*out = value;` has the effect of "copying" `value` into the output sequence thanks to the `Writable` constraint.

The existence of the two distinct concepts results in a partitioning of algorithms into two sets: those that are based on `MoveWritable` or refinements thereof that always move, and those based on `Writable` or refinements thereof that could copy or move or do *both*. In practice, algorithms in the `Writable`/`IndirectlyCopyable` are always specified to copy; passing `move_iterator`s to these algorithms results in either (a) a diagnosis that the program is ill-formed when the value type of the iterator is not copyable, or (b) undefined behavior when the value type of the iterator *is* copyable, but the expression `*out = *in` does not leave the value of `*in` unchanged as required by the semantic constraints of `Writable`. As a result, we need distinct "copy" and "move" variants of algorithms resulting in proliferation. In N4560, for example, there are `partition_move` and `merge_move` algorithms as a result of this issue.

The need to choose between `Writable` and `MoveWritable` also complicates generic code. Consider a simplified variant of the `transform` algorithm:

```c++
template<InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S, WeaklyIncrementable O, class F>
  requires Writable<O, indirect_result_of_t<F&(I)>>()
void transform(I first, S last, O result, F op);
```

Presumably, implementation of this algorithm requires an assignment expression like `*result = op(*first);`. We're again constrained (pun intended) by the choice of concepts: if `op(*first)` returns an rvalue of type `T`, `Writable` unnecesarily requires `T` to be copyable. If `op(*first)` returns an lvalue, `MoveWritable` would allow it to be modified by the assignment. None of the concepts defined in N4560 enable us to constrain `transform` in a manner that is compatible with its semantics in C++14.

Separately, there is a problem using the existing concepts to constrain algorithms that create temporaries. Such algorithms typically require the ability to:

1. construct a temporary object of an iterator's value type from a dereferenced iterator
2. replace the stored value of a temporary by assigning from a dereferenced iterator
3. transfer values between multiple temporaries
4. transfer a value from a temporary into an output sequence

These algorithms are underconstrained in N4560. Wrapping the requirements up into convenient named packages would ease the specification of algorithms.

# Proposed Design

We propose coalescing the existing `Writable` and `MoveWritable` concepts into a single `Writable` concept, and adding concepts `IndirectlyMovableStorable` and `IndirectlyCopyableStorable` for constraining algorithms that use temporaries.

## Coalescing `Writable` and `MoveWritable`

```c++
template <class O, class T>
concept bool Writable() {
  return Semiregular<O>() && requires(O o, T&& t) {
    *o = std::forward<T>(t); // not required to be equality-preserving
  };
}
```
Intuitively, `Writable<O, T>()` is satisfied when an expression with type and value category `T` can be assigned through an iterator with type `O`. For a possibly-cv-qualified non-reference type `T`, `Writable<O, T>` is roughly equivalent to N4560's `MoveWritable<O, T>` and `Writable<O, const T>` is roughly equivalent to N4560's `Writable<O, T>`.

Note that since `OutputIterator<I, T>()` requires `Writable<I, T>()` and `OutputRange<R, T>()` requires `OutputIterator<iterator_t<R>, T>()`, the meaning of those two concepts is changed as well. `OutputIterator<I, T>` no longer means "a value of type `T` can be assigned through an iterator of type `I`," but instead "an *expression* of type and value category `T` can be assigned through an iterator of type `I`." We also need to flow the `Writable` change into `IndirectlyCopyable` and `IndirectlyMovable`. We'll define a new type alias `rvalue_reference_t<In>` for the type of `std::move(*i)` to make the symmetry nicely apparent:

```c++
template <class In>
using rvalue_reference_t = decltype(std::move(declval<reference_t<In&>>()));

template <class In, class Out>
concept bool IndirectlyMovable() {
  return Readable<In>() && Writable<Out, rvalue_reference_t<In>>();
}

template <class In, class Out>
concept bool IndirectlyCopyable() {
  return Readable<In>() && Writable<Out, reference_t<In>>();
}
```
Note that `IndirectlyCopyable` does not refine `IndirectlyMovable` as in N4560: there are no algorithms that use both copy syntax (`*out = *in;`) and move syntax (`*out = std::move(*in);`) to transfer values between their input and output sequences. Even if the `IndirectlyMovable` requirements hold for every "sane" model of `IndirectlyCopyable`, it seems pointless to invest the compile time to validate the "extra" requirements when the algorithm will never use the additional capabilities they provide.

## `Storable` concept variants

We define `Storable` refinements of the `IndirectlyMovable` and `IndirectlyCopyable` concepts to constrain algorithms that sometimes interject temporaries into the communication of values between their input and output sequences:

```c++
template <class In, class Out>
concept bool IndirectlyMovableStorable() {
  return IndirectlyMovable<In, Out>() &&
    Writable<Out, value_type_t<In>>() &&
    Movable<value_type_t<In>>() &&
    Constructible<value_type_t<In>, rvalue_reference_t<In>>() &&
    Assignable<value_type_t<In>&, rvalue_reference_t<In>>();
}

template <class In, class Out>
concept bool IndirectlyCopyableStorable() {
  return IndirectlyCopyable<In, Out>() &&
    Writable<Out, const value_type_t<In>&>() &&
    Copyable<value_type_t<In>>() &&
    Constructible<value_type_t<In>, reference_t<In>>() &&
    Assignable<value_type_t<In>&, reference_t<In>>();
}
```
These definitions include the requirements described earlier for constructing and assigning temporaries from the input sequence, moving/copying between temporaries, and writing temporaries into the output sequence. The names of the concepts themselves are a bit of a mouthful, which issue is ameliorated by the fact that they rarely need to be used directly in the algorithm specifications. If we add an `IndirectlyMovableStorable` requirement to the `Permutable` concept, which is used to constrain the many algorithms that mutate their input sequence by swapping values between elements, the only remaining algorithm needing a constraint is `unique_copy`.

## Eliminating `merge_move` and `partition_move`

With the changes to `Writable` in place, there is no longer a need for separate "copy" and "move" algorithm variants. It is again possible obtain the effect of a "move" algorithm by wrapping an iterator pair in `move_iterator`s and calling the "copy" algorithm. We therefore propose to remove the `merge_move` and `partition_move` algorithms that were added to the TS to workaround this issue.

### Addition of `move_sentinel`

But wait - what if I have an [iterator, sentinel) range instead of an iterator pair? One cannot wrap a sentinel in a `move_iterator`. There are at least three potential solutions:

1. Define a `move_sentinel<S>` wrapper class that satisfies `Sentinel<move_sentinel<S>, move_iterator<I>>()` when `Sentinel<S, I>()` is satisfied. For ease of use, and consistency of interface, define a `make_move_sentinel` deducing helper function. This approach maintains a clear distinction between the adapted range and the underlying range. The definition of `foo` becomes:

    ```c++
    template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S>
    void foo(I first, S last) {
      bar(make_move_iterator(first), make_move_sentinel(last));
    }
    ```

    This approach is straightforward, and while perhaps lacking elegance, gets the job done.

2. Define operator overloads for `==` and `!=` that accept `move_iterator<I>` and `Sentinel<I>` so that move iterators can use the sentinels of their base iterators directly:

    ```c++
    Sentinel{S, I}
    bool operator==(const move_iterator<I>& i, const S& s) {
      return i.current_ == s;
    }
    // Define != similarly, and the symmetric overloads.
    ```
    `foo` can be simpler since it passes the sentinel directly:
    ```c++
    template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S>
    void foo(I first, S last) {
      bar(make_move_iterator(first), last);
    }
    ```

    This approach requires less syntax at the callsite. It is a bit lax in that it allows comparing adapted iterators with unadapted sentinels, potentially creating confusion in code readers about which iterators/sentinels are adapted and which are from the base range.

3. Ignore the problem until Ranges TS2 comes along with support for view adaptors, and the solution will look something like:

    ```c++
    template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S>
    void foo(I first, S last) {
      bar(make_iterator_range(first, last) | view::move);
    }
    // Or even better:
    void foo(InputRange&& rng) {
      bar(rng | view::move);
    }
    ```

    Adapting iterator/sentinel pairs together instead of individually is preferable: it allows the library to check for errors, and to optimize the special case when `last` is also an iterator by producing a bounded range (a range whose `begin` and `end` have the same type).

The view adapter is clearly the preferable solution in the long run, but would require the introduction of too much additional machinery into the current TS to be a viable solution in the short-term. Implementation experience using the underlying sentinels directly with the move iterators was not positive: it results in less clear code, and is fragile in the face of poorly constrained iterators/sentinels. We therefore propose the first approach as an interim solution to this problem.

# Technical Specifications

Rename the section [iterators.movewritable] "Concept MoveWritable" to [iterators.writable] "Concept Writable" and replace its content with:

> The `Writable` concept describes the requirements for writing a value into an iterator's referenced object.
>
> ```c++

>
> Let `v` be an expression such that `decltype(v)` is `T`, and let `o` be a dereferenceable object of type `Out`. Then `Writable<Out, T>()` is satisfied if and only if

Remove the following sections [iterators.writable], [iterators.indirectlymovable], and [iterators.indirectlycopyable].

Relocate [iterators.indirectlyswappable] to before [commonalgoreq.indirectlycomparable]. Replace its stable name (and all references thereto) with [commonalgoreq.indirectlyswappable].

Replace the content of [commonalgoreq.general] with:

> There are several additional iterator concepts that are commonly applied to families of algorithms. These group together iterator requirements of algorithm families. There are three relational concepts that specify how element values are transferred between `Readable` and `Writable` types: `IndirectlyMovable`, `IndirectlyCopyable`, and `IndirectlySwappable`. There are three relational concepts for rearrangements: `Permutable`, `Mergeable`, and `Sortable`. There is one relational concept for comparing values from different sequences: `IndirectlyComparable`.
>
> [ Note: The `equal_to<>` and `less<>` function types used in the concepts below impose additional constraints on their arguments beyond those that appear explicitly in the concepts' bodies. `equal_to<>` requires its arguments satisfy `EqualityComparable`, and `less<>` requires its arguments satisfy `StrictTotallyOrdered`. - end note ]

Immediately thereafter, add a new section [commonalgoreq.indirectlymovable] "Concept IndirectlyMovable", replacing all references to [iterators.indirectlymovable] with [commonalgoreq.indirectlymovable] - and content:

> The `IndirectlyMovable` concept specifies the relationship between a `Readable` type and a `Writable` type between which values may be moved.

>   }
> ```

Immediately thereafter, add a new section [commonalgoreq.indirectlycopyable] "Concept IndirectlyCopyable", replacing all references to [iterators.indirectlycopyable] with [commonalgoreq.indirectlycopyable] - and content:

> The `IndirectlyCopyable` concept specifies the relationship between a `Readable` type and a `Writable` type between which values may be copied.

> The `IndirectlyCopyableStorable` concept augments `IndirectlyCopyable` with additional requirements enabling the transfer to be performed through an intermediate object of the `Readable` type's value type. It also requires the capability to make copies of values.

In [commonalgoreq.permutable], replace the concept definition with:

```c++
  template <class I>
  concept bool Permutable() {
    return ForwardIterator<I>() &&
      IndirectlyMovableStorable<I, I>() &&
      IndirectlySwappable<I, I>();
  }
```

Remove the section [commonalgoreq.mergemovable].

Add the following declarations to the synopsis of the `<experimental/ranges/iterator>` head in [iterator.synopsis], between the `move_iterator` and `common_iterator` declarations:

> ```c++
> template <Semiregular S> class move_sentinel;
> template <class I, Sentinel<I> S>

>   move_sentinel<S> make_move_sentinel(S s);
> ```

In [iterators.move]/1 unstrike the text "Some generic algorithms can be called with move iterators to replace copying with moving." and remove the now-inaccurate editorial note that follows. After the example, add new paragraphs:

> Class template `move_sentinel` is a sentinel adaptor useful for denoting ranges together with `move_iterator`. When an input iterator type `I` and sentinel type `S` satisfy `Sentinel<S, I>()`, `Sentinel<move_sentinel<S>, move_iterator<I>>()` is satisfied as well.

Throughout Clause 25 [algorithms] replace occurrences of `Writable<I, T>`, `OutputIterator<T>`, and `OutputRange<T>` with `Writable<I, const T&>`, `OutputIterator<const T&>`, and `OutputRange<const T&>` respectively.

In the synopsis of the `<experimental/ranges/algorithm>` header in [algorithms.general], in the declarations of `unique_copy`, replace the constraint clause `Copyable<value_type_t<I>>()` (resp. `Copyable<value_type_t<iterator_t<Rng>>>()`) with `IndirectlyCopyableStorable<I, O>()` (resp. `IndirectlyCopyableStorable<iterator_t<Rng>, O>()`). Remove both declarations of `partition_move` and `merge_move`.

In [alg.unique], in the declarations of `unique_copy`, again replace the constraint clauses `Copyable<value_type_t<I>>()` (resp. `Copyable<value_type_t<iterator_t<Rng>>>()`) with `IndirectlyCopyableStorable<I, O>()` (resp. `IndirectlyCopyableStorable<iterator_t<Rng>, O>()`).

In [alg.partitions], strike the declarations of `partition_move` and remove paragraphs 16-19 that specify its behavior.

In [alg.merge], strike the declarations of `merge_move` adn remove paragraphs 6-10 that specify its behavior.

<!--
Algorithms
==========
There are several small issues that apply to many or all of the algorithm specifications that must be addressed by the addition of requirements in [algorithms.general]. First, an ambiguity exists for algorithms with both a two-range overload and a range + iterator overload, e.g.:

```c++
template <Range R1, Range R2>
void foo(R1&&, R2&&);

template <Range R, Iterator I>
void foo(R&&, I);
```
overload resolution is ambiguous when passing an array as the second parameter of `foo`, since arrays decay to pointers. Resolving this ambiguity is not complicated, but would muddy the algorithm declarations. Instead of altering the declarations, we require implementors to resolve the ambiguity in a new paragraph at the end of [algorithms.general]:

> 16 Some algorithms declare both an overload that takes a `Range` and an `Iterator`, and an overload that takes two `Range` parameters. Since an array type (3.9.2) both satisfies `Range` and decays to a pointer (4.2) which satisfies `Iterator`, such overloads are ambiguous when an array is passed as the second argument. Implementations shall provide a mechanism to resolve this ambiguity in favor of the overload that takes two ranges.

The Ranges TS adds many "range" algorithm overloads that are specified to forward to "iterator" overloads. Implementing such a range overload by directly forwarding would create inefficiencies due to introducing additional copies or moves of the arguments, e.g. `find_if` could be implemented as:

```c++
template<InputRange Rng, class Proj = identity,
  IndirectCallablePredicate<Projected<IteratorType<Rng>, Proj>> Pred>
safe_iterator_t<Rng>
  find_if(Rng&& rng, Pred pred, Proj proj = Proj{}) {
    return find_if(begin(rng), end(rng), std::move(pred), std::move(proj));
  }
```

which introduces moves of `pred` and `proj` that could be eliminated by perfect forwarding:

```c++
template<InputRange Rng, class Proj, class Pred>
  requires IndirectCallablePredicate<decay_t<Pred>, Projected<iterator_t<Rng>, decay_t<Proj>>>()
safe_iterator_t<Rng>
  find_if(Rng&& rng, Pred&& pred, Proj&& proj) {
    return find_if(begin(rng), end(rng), std::forward<Pred>(pred), std::forward<Proj>(proj));
  }

template<InputRange Rng, class Pred>
  requires IndirectCallablePredicate<decay_t<Pred>, iterator_t<Rng>>()
safe_iterator_t<Rng>
  find_if(Rng&& rng, Pred&& pred) {
    return find_if(begin(rng), end(rng), std::forward<Pred>(pred));
  }
```

except that forwarding arguments in this manner is visible to users, and so not permitted under the as-if rule: the forwarding implementation sequences the calls to begin and end *before* the actual arguments to `pred` and `proj` are copied or moved, whereas the non-forwarding implementation sequences those class *after* the argument expressions to `pred` and `proj` are copied/moved into their argument objects. To provide increased implementor freedom to perform such optimizations, and to implement the iterator/range disambiguation for arrays discussed above, we propose that the number and order of template parameters to algorithms be unspecified, and that the creation of the actual argument objects from the argument expressions be decoupled from the algorithm invocation. Such a decoupling would allow an algorithm implementation to omit or delay creation of its nominal argument objects from the actual argument expressions. These proposals can each be specified with new paragraphs in [algorithm.general]:

> 17 The number and order of template parameters for algorithm declarations is unspecified, except where explicitly stated otherwise.

> 18 Despite that the algorithm declarations nominally accept parameters by value, it is unspecified when and if the argument expressions are used to initialize the actual parameters except that any such initialization shall be sequenced before (1.9) the algorithm returns. [ Note: The behavior of a program that modifies the values of the actual argument expressions is consequently undefined unless the algorithm return happens before (1.10) any such modifications. ---end note ]

These changes make both of the example implementations of `find_if` above conforming.


Function -> Callable
====================
A thorough examination of the Ranges TS shows that the `Function` concept family (`Function`, `RegularFunction`, `Predicate`, `Relation`, and `StrictWeakOrder`; described in [concepts.lib.functions]) is only used in the definition of the `IndirectCallableXXX` concept family. All predicates and projections used by the algorithms are actually *callables*: object types that are evaluated via the `INVOKE` metasyntactic function. We propose to greatly simplify the specification by importing `std::invoke` from the C++ WP and replacing the `Function` concept family with a similar family of `Callable` concepts. This enables the replacement of all declarations of the form `Function<FunctionType<F>, Args...>` with `Callable<F, Args...>`, and elimination of the `as_function` machinery.

Rename section [concepts.lib.functions] to [concepts.lib.callables]; similarly rename all subsections of the form [concepts.lib.functions.Xfunction] to [concepts.lib.callables.Xcallable]. Replace the content of the section now named [concepts.lib.callables.callable]:

> 1 The `Callable` concept specifies a relationship between a callable type (20.9.1) `F` and a set of argument types `Args...` which can be evaluated by the library function `invoke` (20.9.3).

> ```c++

> concept bool Callable() {
>   return CopyConstructible<F>() &&
>     requires (F f, Args&&...args) {
>       invoke(f, std::forward<Args>(args)...); // not required to be equality preserving
>     };
> }
> ```

> 2 [ Note: Since the `invoke` function call expression is not required to be equality-preserving (19.1.1), a function that generates random numbers may satisfy `Callable`. ---end note ]

and the section [concepts.lib.callables.regularcallable]:

> ```c++
> concept bool RegularCallable() {
>   return Callable<F, Args...>();
> }
> ```

> 1 The `invoke` function call expression shall be equality-preserving (19.1.1). [ Note: This requirement supersedes the annotation in the definition of `Callable`. ---end note ]

> 2 [ Note: A random number generator does not satisfy `RegularCallable`. ---end note ]

> 3 [ Note: The distinction between `Callable` and `RegularCallable` is purely semantic. ---end note ]

in section [concepts.lib.callables.predicate], replace references to `RegularFunction` with `RegularCallable`. In [function.objects], add to the synopsis of header `<experimental/ranges/functional>` the declaration:

> ```c++
> template <class F, class... Args>
> result_of_t<F&&(Args&&...)> invoke(F&& f, Args&&... args);
> ```

Insert a new subsection [func.invoke] under [function.objects]:

> ```c++
> result_of_t<F&&(Args&&...)> invoke(F&& f, Args&&... args);
> ```
> 1 Effects: Equivalent to `INVOKE(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...)` (20.9.2).

Remove the section [indirectcallables.functiontype]. In [indirectcallables.indirectfunc], replace the concept definitions with:

> ```c++

Replace the definition of `projected` in [projected] with:

> ```c++
> template <Readable I, IndirectRegularCallable<I> Proj>
>   requires RegularCallable<Proj, reference_t<I>>()
> struct projected {
>   using value_type = decay_t<indirect_result_of_t<Proj&(I)>>;
>   result_of_t<Proj&(reference_t<I>)> operator*() const;

> ```

In [algorithm] replace references to `Function` with `Callable`. Strike paragraph [algorithm.general]/10 that describes how the algorithms use the removed `as_function` to implement predicate and projection callables. Replace all references to `INVOKE` in the algorithm descriptions with `invoke`. Replace the descriptive text in [alg.generate] with:

> Effects: Assigns the value of `invoke(gen)` through successive iterators in the range `[first,last)`, where `last` is `first + max(n, 0)` for `generate_n`.

> Returns: `last`.

> Complexity: Exactly `last - first` evaluations of `invoke(gen)` and assignments.


Assignable Semantics
====================
There seems to be some confusion in the Ranges TS about the relationship between the `Movable` and `Swappable` concepts. For example, the `Permutable` concept is required by algorithms that swap range elements, and it requires `IndirectlyMovable` instead of `IndirectlySwappable`. The specification of `swap` itself requires `Movable` elements. Does that imply that a `Movable` type `T` must satisfy `Swappable`? Certainly we experienced C++ programmers know the requirements for `std::swap` well enough that we often conflate movability with swappability.

Unfortunately, the answer to this leading question is "no." If `a` and `b` are lvalues of some `Movable` type `T`, then certainly `std::swap(a, b)` will swap the denoted values. However, `Swappable` requires that an overload found by ADL, if any, must exchange the denoted values. There is nothing in the `Movable` concept that forbids definition of a function `swap` that accepts two lvalue references to `T` and launches the missiles. We *could* redress this issue by better distinguishing move and swap operations, fastidiously requiring `Swappable` in the proper places, and attempting to better educate C++ users. However, it is our belief that this issue is so engrained in C++ culture that it would be best to make it valid.

Consequently, we propose the addition of semantic requirements to the previously purely syntactic `Assignable` concept, which when combined with `MoveConstructible` suffice to support implementation of the "default" `swap`. Specifically, we relocate the semantic requirements on the assignment expressions from `Movable` and `Copyable` to `Assignable`, which also simplifies the definitions of those two concepts. We then add a `Swappable` requirement to `Movable`, bringing `Swappable` properly into the object concept hierarchy.

Replace the content of [concepts.lib.corelang.assignable] with:

> ```c++
> template <class T, class U>
> concept bool Assignable() {
>   return Common<T, U>() && requires(T&& a, U&& b) {
>     { std::forward<T>(a) = std::forward<U>(b) } -> Same<T&>;
>   };
> }
> ```

> 1 Let `t` be an lvalue of type `T`, and `R` be the type `remove_reference_t<U>`. If `U` is an lvalue reference type, let `v` be a lvalue of type `R`; otherwise, let `v` be an rvalue of type `R`. Let `uu` be a distinct object of type `R` such that `uu == v`. Then `Assignable<T, U>()` is satisfied if and only if

> * `std::addressof(t = v) == std::addressof(t)`.

> * After evaluating `t = v`:

>   * `t == uu`.

>   * If `v` is a non-const rvalue, its resulting state is unspecified. [Note: `v` must still meet the requirements of the library component that is using it. The operations listed in those requirements must work as specified. ---end note ]

>   * Otherwise, `v` is not modified.

The entire content of [concepts.lib.object.movable] becomes:

> ```c++
> template <class T>
> concept bool Movable() {
>   return MoveConstructible<T>() &&
>     Assignable<T&, T&&>() &&
>     Swappable<T&>();
> }
> ```

Since the prose requirements are now redundant. As are those in [concepts.lib.object.copyable], which also now becomes simply a concept definition:

> ```c++
> template <class T>
> concept bool Copyable() {
>   return CopyConstructible<T>() &&
>     Movable<T>() &&
>     Assignable<T&, const T&>();
> }
> ```

It is now possible to change the `Movable` requirement on `exchange` in the `<experimental/ranges/utility>` header synopsis of [utility]/2 and its definition in [utility.exchange] to `MoveConstructible`:

> ```c++
> template <MoveConstructible T, class U=T>
> requires Assignable<T&, U>()
> T exchange(T& obj, U&& new_val);
> ```

which suffices to implement `exchange` along with the stronger `Assignable` semantics. (A similar change could be applied to the definition of the default `swap` implementation. We don't propose this here as we've already included the effect in the definition of the `swap` customization point earlier.)


# Customization Points
Customization points are pain points, as the motivation of N4381 makes clear:

> The correct usage of customization points like `swap` is to first bring the standard `swap` into scope with a using declaration, and then to call `swap` unqualified:

> ```c++
> using std::swap;
> swap(a, b);
> ```

> One problem with this approach is that it is error-prone. It is all too easy to call (qualified) `std::swap` in a generic context, which is potentially wrong since it will fail to find any user-defined overloads.

> Another potential problem – and one that will likely become bigger with the advent of Concepts Lite – is the inability to centralize constraints-checking. Suppose that a future version of `std::begin` requires that its argument model a Range concept. Adding such a constraint would have no effect on code that uses `std::begin` idiomatically:

> ```c++
> using std::begin;
> begin(a);
> ```

> If the call to `begin` dispatches to a user-defined overload, then the constraint on `std::begin` has been bypassed.

> This paper aims to rectify these problems by recommending that future customization points be global function objects that do argument dependent lookup internally on the users’ behalf.

The range access customization points - those defined in [iterator.range], literally titled "Range Access" - should enforce "range-ness" via constraints. As constraints are pushed futher out into the "leaves" of the design, diagnostics occur closer to the point of the actual error. This design principle drives conceptification of the standard library, and it applies to customization points just as well as algorithms. Applying constraints to the customization points even enables catching errors in code that treats an argument as a range but does not properly constrain it to be so.

The same argument applies to the "Container access" customization points defined in [iterator.container] in the Working Paper. It's peculiar that these are in a distinct section from [iterator.range], since there seems to be nothing container-specific in their definitions. They seem to actually be range access customization points as well.

The Ranges TS has another customization point problem that N4381 does not cover: an implementation of the Ranges TS needs to co-exist alongside an implementation of the standard library. There's little benefit to providing customization points with strong semantic constraints if ADL can result in calls to the customization points of the same name in namespace `std`. For example, consider the definition of the single-type `Swappable` concept:

```c++
namespace std { namespace experimental { namespace ranges { inline namespace v1 {
  template <class T>
  concept bool Swappable() {
    return requires(T&& t, T&& u) {
      (void)swap(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<T>(u));
    };
  }
}}}}
```

unqualified name lookup for the name `swap` could find the unconstrained `swap` in namespace `std` either directly - it's only a couple of hops up the namespace hierarchy - or via ADL if `std` is an associated namespace of `T` or `U`. If `std::swap` is unconstrained, the concept is "satisfied" for all types, and effectively useless. The Ranges TS deals with this problem by requiring changes to `std::swap`, a practice which has historically been forbidden for TSs. Applying similar constraints to all of the customization points defined in the TS by modifying the definitions in namespace `std` is an unsatisfactory solution, if not an altogether untenable.

We propose a combination of the approach used in N4381 with a "poison pill" technique to correct the lookup problem. Namely, we specify that unqualified lookup intended to find user-defined overloads via ADL must be performed in a context that includes a deleted overload matching the signature of the implementation in namespace `std`. E.g., for the customization point `begin`, the unqualified lookup for `begin(E)` (for some arbitrary expression `E`) is performed in a context that includes the declaration `void begin(const auto&) = delete;`. This "poison pill" has two distinct effects on overload resolution. First, the poison pill hides the declaration in namespace `std` from normal unqualified lookup, simply by having the same name. Second, for actual argument expressions for which the overload in namespace `std` is viable and found by ADL, the poisin pill will also be viable causing overload resolution to fail due to ambiguity. The net effect is to preclude the overload in namespace `std` from being chosen by overload resolution, or indeed any overload found by ADL that is not more specialized or more constrained than the poison pill.

All of this complicated customization point machinery is necessary to facilitate strong semantics through the addition of constraints. Let `E` be an arbitrary expression that denotes a range. The type of `begin(E)` must satisfy `Iterator`, so the customization point `begin` should constrain its return type to satisfy `Iterator`. Similarly, `end` should constrain its return type to satisfy `Sentinel<decltype(end(E)), decltype(begin(E))>()` since the iterator and sentinel types of a range must satisfy `Sentinel`. The constraints on `begin` and `end` should apply equally to the `const` and/or `reverse` variants thereof: `cbegin`, `cend`, `rbegin`, `rend`, `crbegin`, and `crend`. The size of a `SizedRange` always has a type the satisfies `Integral`, so the customization point `size` should should constrain its return type to satisfy `Integral`. `empty` should constrain its return type to be exactly `bool`. (Requiring the return type of `empty` to satisfy `Boolean` would also be a reasonable choice, but there seems to be no motivating reason for that relaxation at this time.)

## Technical Specifications
Add a new subsection to the end of [type.descriptions] to introduce *customization point object* as a term of art:

> 1 A *customization point object* is a function object (20.9) with a literal class type that interacts with user-defined types while enforcing semantic requirements on that interaction.

> 2 The type of a customization point object shall satisfy `Semiregular` (19.4.8).

> 3 All instances of a specific customization point object type shall be equal.

> 4 The type of a customization point object `T` shall satisfy `Function<const T, Args..>()` (19.5.2) when the types of `Args...` meet the requirements specified in that customization point object’s definition. Otherwise, `T` shall not have a function call operator that participates in overload resolution.

> 5 Each customization point object type constrains its return type to satisfy a particular concept.

> 6 The library defines several named customization point objects. In every translation unit where such a name is defined, it shall refer to the same instance of the customization point object.

> 7 [ Note: Many of the customization points objects in the library evaluate function call expressions with an unqualified name which results in a call to a user-defined function found by argument dependent name lookup (3.4.2). To preclude such an expression resulting in a call to unconstrained functions with the same name in namespace `std`, customization point objects specify that lookup for these expressions is performed in a context that includes deleted overloads matching the signatures of overloads defined in namespace `std`. When the deleted overloads are viable, user-defined overloads must be more specialized (14.5.6.2) or more constrained (Concepts TS [temp.constr.order]) to be used by a customization point object. ---end note]

In [concepts.lib.corelang.swappable], replace references to `swap` in the concept definitions with references to `ranges::swap`, to make it clear that the name is used qualified here, and remove the casts to `void`:

> ```c++
> template <class T>
> concept bool Swappable() {
>   return requires(T&& a, T&& b) {
>     ranges::swap(std::forward<T>(a), std::forward<T>(b));
>   };
> }
>
> template <class T, class U>
> concept bool Swappable() {
>   return Swappable<T>() &&
>     Swappable<U>() &&
>     Common<T, U>() &&
>     requires(T&& t, U&& u) {
>       ranges::swap(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u));
>       ranges::swap(std::forward<U>(u), std::forward<T>(t));
>     };
> }
> ```

Strike the entire note in paragraph 1 that explains the purpose of the casts to `void`.

Change paragraph 3 to read:

> An object `t` is *swappable with* an object `u` if and only if `Swappable<T, U>()` is satisfied. `Swappable<T, U>()` is satisfied if and only if given distinct objects `tt` equal to `t` and `uu` equal to `u`, after evaluating either `ranges::swap(t, u)` or `ranges::swap(u, t)`, `tt` is equal to `u` and `uu` is equal to `t`.

Strike paragraph 4.

In [utility], strike paragraph 1 (the modifications to the synposis of the standard header `utility`).

In paragraph 2, the synopsis of the header `experimental/ranges/utility`, strike `using std::swap;` and insert the text:
```c++
namespace {
  constexpr unspecified swap = unspecified;
}
```
Replace the entire content of [utility.swap] with:

> The name `swap` denotes a customization point object (17.5.2.1.5). The effect of the expression `ranges::swap(E1, E2)` for some expressions `E1` and `E2` is equivalent to:

> void swap(T(&)[N], T(&)[N]) = delete;
> ```
> and does not include a declaration of `ranges::swap`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not exchange the values denoted by `E1` and `E2`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

> * Otherwise, `(void)swap_ranges(E1, E2)` if `E1` and `E2` are lvalues of array types (3.9.2) of equal extent and `ranges::swap(*(E1), *(E2))` is a valid expression, except that `noexcept(ranges::swap(E1, E2))` is equal to `noexcept(ranges::swap(*(E1), *(E2)))`.

> * Otherwise, if `E1` and `E2` are lvalues of the same type `T` which meets the syntactic requirements of `MoveConstructible<T>()` and `Assignable<T&, T&&>()`, exchanges the denoted values. `ranges::swap(E1, E2)` is a constant expression if the constructor selected by overload resolution for `T{std::move(E1)}` is a `constexpr` constructor and the expression `E1 = std::move(E2)` can appear in a `constexpr` function. `noexcept(ranges::swap(E1, E2))` is equal to `is_nothrow_move_constructible<T>::value && is_nothrow_move_assignable<T>::value`. If either `MoveConstructible<T>()` or `Assignable<T&, T&&>()` is not satisfied, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required. `ranges::swap(E1, E2)` has type `void`.

> * Otherwise, `ranges::swap(E1, E2)` is ill-formed.

> Remark: Whenever `ranges::swap(E1, E2)` is a valid expression, it exchanges the values denoted by `E1` and `E2` and has type `void`.

Note that This formulation intentionally allows swapping arrays with identical extent and differing element types, but only when swapping the element types is well-defined. Swapping arrays of `int` and `double` continues to be ill-formed, but arrays of `T` and `U` are swappable whenever `T&` and `U&` are swappable.

In [taggedtup.tagged], add to the synopsis of class template `tagged` the declaration:

> ```c++
> friend void swap(tagged&, tagged&) noexcept(see below )
> requires Swappable<Base&>();
> ```

and remove the non-member `swap` function declaration. Add paragraphs specifying the `swap` friend:

> ```c++
> friend void swap(tagged& lhs, tagged& rhs) noexcept(see below )
> requires Swappable<Base&>();
> ```

> 23 Remarks: The expression in the `noexcept` is equivalent to `noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs))`

> 24 Effects: `lhs.swap(rhs)`.

> 25 Throws: Nothing unless the call to `lhs.swap(rhs)` throws.

Strike the section [tagged.special] that describes the non-member `swap` overload.

From [iterator.synopsis], strike the declarations of the "Range access" customization points:

Iterator/Sentinel Overhaul
==========================
One of the differences between the iterator model of the Ranges TS and that of Standard C++ is that the difference operation, as represented in the `SizedIteratorRange` concept, has been made semi-orthogonal to iterator category. Random access iterators *must* satisfy `SizedIteratorRange`, iterators of other categories *may* satisfy `SizedIteratorRange`. `SizedRange` provides a similar facility for ranges that know how many elements they contain, even if pairs of their iterators don't know how far apart they are. The TS has a mechanism for ranges to opt out of "sized-ness", but doesn't provide a similar mechanism for iterator and sentinel type pairs to opt out of "sized-ness."

Why is this even a concern? The specification of some functions in the library assumes they can be implemented to take advantage of size/distance information when available. In some cases the requirement is explicit:

> ```c++
> template <Range R>
> DifferenceType<IteratorType<R>> distance(R&& r);
> ```

> 1 Returns: `ranges::distance(begin(r), end(r))`

> ```c++
> template <SizedRange R>
> DifferenceType<IteratorType<R>> distance(R&& r);
> ```

> 2 Returns: `size(r)`

and in others, implicit:

> ```c++
> template <Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S>
> void advance(I& i, S bound);
> ```

> ...

> 7 If `SizedIteratorRange<I,S>()` is satisfied, equivalent to: `advance(i, bound - i)`.

Many of the algorithms have implementations that can take advantage of size information as well. We see three design choices for the use of size information in the library:

1. The requirement is always made explicit, as with `distance` above. A function with an alternative implementation that uses size information must be presented as an explicit overload that requires `SizedRange` or `SizedIteratorRange`. Users can see immediately whether or not they may legally pass a parameter that "looks like" it is `Sized` (i.e., meets the syntactic requirements but not the semantic requirements of the pertinent `Sized` concept) to a function.

2. Requirements can be implicit, as with `advance` above. To determine whether or not a user may legally pass a parameter that "looks like" it is `Sized`, the user examine the specification of that function and possibly the specifications of other functions that it is specified to use.

3. Make a library-wide blanket requirement that all ranges/iterator-and-sentinel pairs that meet the syntax of the pertinent `Sized` concept *must* meet the semantics.

Choices 1 & 2 suffer from the same problems. They require that the entire library be explicitly partitioned at specification time into components that may or may not use size information in their implementations. They require that users be familiar with (or have *exhaustive* knowledge for choice 2) the specifications of the library components to know which are "safe" to use. There is an enormous specification load on the library, and cognitive load on the users, to support what are essentially near-pathological corner case iterators & ranges.

Choice 3 is effectively a library-wide "duck typing" rule for a very specific case: it allows a library component to treat a parameter that is known to be a bird (e.g., `Range`) as a duck (e.g., `SizedRange`) if it looks like a duck. While this rule is also implicit, it has the advantage of being applied uniformly library-wide. We propose that choice 3 be used for the Ranges TS and that a mechanism similar to that used to opt out of `SizedRange` be provided for iterator/sentinel type pairs to opt out of `SizedIteratorRange`.

In passing, we note that the name `SizedIteratorRange` is confusing in the context of the TS, where all other `XXXRange` concepts are refinements of `Range`. Since `SizedIteratorRange` is a refinement of `Sentinel`, we think the name `SizedSentinel` is more appropriate. The template parameter order should be changed for consistency with the parameter order of `Sentinel`. Also, relocating the concept definition from its lonely section [iteratorranges.sizediteratorrange] - the sole subsection of [iteratorranges] - to be immediately after the definition of `Sentinel` produces a more comprehensible specification.

A thorough audit of iterator/sentinel semantics provides some opportunities to cleanup the language in [iterator.requirements.general], and sharpen the specifications of the iterator and sentinel concepts. Unfortunately, we notice a problem along the way: an inconsistency in the `Sentinel` semantics.

`Sentinel<S, I>()` requires `EqualityComparable<S, I>()`, which in turn requires that whenever `s1 == s2 && i1 == i2 && s1 == i1` for some values `s1, s2` and `i1, i2` of types `S` and `I`, that `s1 == i2 && s2 == i1` must also hold. Cross-type `EqualityComparable` (EC) establishes a tight correspondence between the values of the two types so that `==` is transitive across types. Cross-type EC also requires the partipant types to individually satisfy single-type EC which requires `==` to mean "equals," i.e., substitutable in equality-preserving expressions.

Let's try to define a sentinel type for pointers to "`int` that is less than some specified bound":

```c++
struct S {
  int bound;

  bool operator == (const S& that) const { return bound == that.bound; }
  bool operator != (const S& that) const { return !(*this == that); }

  friend bool operator == (const S& s, const int* p) {
    return *p >= s.bound;
  }
  friend bool operator == (const int* p, const S& s) {
    return s == p;
  }
  friend bool operator != (const int* p, const S& s) {
    return !(s == p);
  }
  friend bool operator != (const S& s, const int* p) {
    return !(s == p);
  }
};

int a[] = {1,2};
```
Is `Sentinel<S, int*>()` satisfied? Clearly the syntactic requirements are met. Consider the ranges `[a+1,S{1})` and `[a+1,S{2})`. Both `a+1 == S{1}` and `a+1 == S{2}` hold, so both ranges are empty. By cross-type EC, `(a+1 == S{1}) && (a+1 == S{2})` implies that `S{1} == S{2}` which is certainly NOT true from the definition of `S::operator==`. `S` is not a proper sentinel for `int*`.

Much of the literature around sentinels suggests that "sentinels should always compare equal." If we alter the definition of `S::operator==` so that it always returns `true`, the problem above is solved. But now consider the ranges `[a+0,S{1})` and `[a+0,S{2})`. We know from the examination of `[a+1,S{1})` and `[a+1,S{2})` that `S{1} == S{2}`. Single-type EC tells us that `S{1}` and `S{2}` must be equal (substitutable in equality-preserving expressions). But then `a+0 == S{1}` (1 >= 1) implies that `a+0 == S{2}` (1 >= 2). Another contradiction.

The principle at work here is a fundamental property of `EqualityComparable` types: any state that affects the observable behavior of an object - as witnessed by equality-preserving expressions - must participate in that object's value. Otherwise, two objects differing only in that state are `==` but NOT "equal," breaking single-type `EqualityComparable`'s requirement that `==` means "equals." We must either abandon what seems to be a large class of useful stateful sentinels, or reformulate the `Sentinel` concept to not require cross-type `EqualityComparable` and the resultant transitivity of `==`.

If we can't put sentinels into a correspondence with iterators, then sentinels must not represent *positions*. What then, are they? A perusal of the algorithms makes it clear what they require of sentinels (using `i` and `s` to denote an iterator and a sentinel):

* `i == s`, `i != s`, `s == i`, and `s != i` must all be equality-preserving expressions with the same domain
* Complement: `i != s` must be the complement of `i == s`
* Symmetry: `i == s` must be equivalent to `s == i`, and `s != i` equivalent to `i != s`
* `i == s` must be well-defined when `[i,s)` denotes a range

All requirements but the last are not particular to iterators and sentinels. We propose they be combined into a new comparison concept:

> ```c++
> template <class T, class U>
> concept bool WeaklyEqualityComparable() {
>   return requires(const T t, const U u) {
>     { t == u } -> Boolean;
>     { u == t } -> Boolean;
>     { t != u } -> Boolean;
>     { u != t } -> Boolean;
>   };
> }
> ```

> 1 Let `t` and `u` be objects of types `T` and `U`. `WeaklyEqualityComparable<T, U>()` is satisfied if and only if:

> * `t == u`, `u == t`, `t != u`, and `u != t` have the same domain.

> * `bool(u == t) == bool(t == u)`.

> * `bool(t != u) == !bool(t == u)`.

> * `bool(u != t) == bool(t != u)`.

`WeaklyEqualityComparable` can then be refined by `EqualityComparable<T>`, `EqualityComparable<T, U>`, and `Sentinel`.

We also note that the algorithms don't require comparison of sentinels with sentinels; we therefore propose that sentinels be `Semiregular` instead of `Regular`.

Comparing sentinels with other sentinels isn't the only operation that is not useful to generic code: the algorithms never compare input / output iterators with input / output iterators. They only compare input / output iterators with sentinels. The reason for this is fairly obvious: input / output ranges are single-pass, so an iterator + sentinel algorithm only has access to one valid iterator value at a time; the "current" value. Obviously the "current" value is always equal to itself.

The only difference between the `Weak` and non-`Weak` variants of the `Iterator`, `InputIterator`, and `OutputIterator` concepts is the requirement for equality comparison. Why have concepts that only differ by the addition of a useless requirement? Indeed the `==` operator is slightly worse than useless since its domain is so narrow: It always either returns `true` or has undefined behavior. Of course, now that we've relaxed the Sentinel relationship the design can support "weak" ranges: ranges delimited by a "weak" iterator and a sentinel. We therefore propose that `Sentinel` be relaxed to specify the relationship between a `WeakIterator` and a `Semiregular` type that denote a range.

We also propose that `ForwardIterator<I>` be specified to refine `Sentinel<I, I>` instead of `Iterator`, after which it becomes clear that the `Iterator`, `InputIterator`, and `OutputIterator` concepts have become extraneous. The algorithms and operations can all be respecified in terms of the `Weak` variants where necessary. We propose doing so,  eliminating the non-`Weak` concepts altogether, and then stripping the `Weak` prefix from the names of `WeakIterator`, `WeakInputIterator`, and `WeakOutputIterator`.

In [iterator.requirements.general]/1, strike the words "for which equality is defined" (all iterators have a difference type in the Ranges TS). In paras 2 and 3 and table 4, replace "seven" with "five" and strike references to weak input / output iterators. Strike the word "Weak" from para 5. Replace paras 7 through 9 with:

> 7 Most of the library’s algorithmic templates that operate on data structures have interfaces that use ranges. A range is an iterator and a *sentinel* that designate the beginning and end of the computation.

> 8 A sentinel `s` is called *reachable* from an iterator `i` if and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of the expression `++i` that makes `i == s`. If `s` is reachable from `i`, they denote a range.

> 9 A range `[i,s)` is empty if `i == s`; otherwise, `[i,s)` refers to the elements in the data structure starting with the element pointed to by `i` and up to but not including the element pointed to by the first iterator `j` such that `j == s`.

> 10 A range `[i,s)` is valid if and only if `s` is reachable from `i`. The result of the application of functions in the library to invalid ranges is undefined.

Strike paragraph 13.

Strike section [iterators.iterator], and rename section [iterators.weakiterator] to [iterators.iterator]. Strike the prefix `Weak` wherever it appears in the section.

and replace the block of declarations in namespace `std`:

> ```c++
> namespace std {
>   // 24.6.2, iterator traits
>   template <experimental::ranges::Iterator I>
>   struct iterator_traits;
>   template <experimental::ranges::InputIterator I>
>   struct iterator_traits;
>   template <experimental::ranges::InputIterator I>
>     requires Sentinel<I, I>()
>   struct iterator_traits;
> }
> ```

In [iterator.assoc]/10, strip occurrences of the `Weak` prefix.

In [iterator.stdtraits], Add the clause `requires Sentinel<I, In>()` to the declaration of the `iterator_traits` partial specialization that has no `Weak` prefix. Strip occurrences of the `Weak` prefix.

In [std.iterator.tags], strike `weak_input_iterator_tag` as in the synopsis.

Replace the content of [iterator.operations] with the content of the section of the same name in N4569.

In [iterators.common]/2, strike ", and for use in common_type specializations that are required to make
iterator/sentinel pairs satisfy the EqualityComparable concept"

Replace the contents of [iterators.common], [default.sentinels], [iterators.counted], and [unreachable.sentinels] with the contents of the sections of the same name in N4569.

Strip occurrences of the prefix `Weak` wherever it appears in clause [algorithms].

### Implementation Experience
The proposed design changes are implemented in both [CMCSTL2, a full implementation of the Ranges TS with proxy extensions][2][@cmcstl2], and [range-v3][5][@range-v3].
