\chapter{Foreword}
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International
Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization.
National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of
International Standards through technical committees established by the respective
organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC,
also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC
have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1.  In particular the
different approval criteria needed for the different types of document should be
noted.  This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the
ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see \url{www.iso.org/directives}).

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document
may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible
for identifying any or all such patent rights.  Details of any patent rights
identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction
and/or on the ISO list of patent declarations received (see \url{www.iso.org/patents}).

Any trade name used in this document is information given for the convenience of
users and does not constitute an endorsement.

For an explanation on the voluntary nature of standards, the meaning of ISO
specific terms and expressions related to conformity assessment, as well as
information about ISO's adherence to the World Trade Organization (WTO) principles

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, \emph{Information
technology}, Subcommittee SC 22, \emph{Programming languages, their environments and
system software interfaces}.
