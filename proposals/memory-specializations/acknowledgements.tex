This proposal is heavily based upon the design of the Ranges TS
Draft~(\ref{intro.refs}). Without the Ranges TS Draft, it would
not have been possible for this proposal to exist. Both the
document style and \LaTeX source for this proposal have been
\changed{plagiarised from}{stronly influenced by} the Ranges TS
Draft.

Special acknowledgement should be given to Eric Niebler and Casey
Carter for their guidance and encouragement. Casey also provided
\tcode{uninitialized_copy} and \tcode{uninitialized_copy_n} as a
``kickstart'' for this proposal.
