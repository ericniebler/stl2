This proposal is heavily based upon the design of the Ranges TS
~(\ref{intro.refs}). Without the Ranges TS, it would
not have been possible for this proposal to exist. Both the
document style and \LaTeX source for this proposal have been
\changed{plagiarised from}{stronly influenced by} the Ranges TS.

Special acknowledgement should be given to Eric Niebler and Casey
Carter for their guidance, encouragement, and significant reviews
to the original drafts of this proposal prior to its submission.
Casey also provided the original \tcode{uninitialized_copy} and
\tcode{uninitialized_copy_n} as a ``kickstart'' for this proposal,
and reviewed the reference implementation (mentioned below).
